	- parallel
		- contains parallel implementation
		- contains following files/folders:
			- genExpMat.sh	- main script to trigger the creation of expression matrix
			- jnomics-code/ - contains Jnomics code

	- serial
		- contains serial implementation
		- contains following files:
			- genPileUp.sh
			- calAvgDepth.cpp
		- please note that there is a minor bug in serial implementation. The bug is that we
		  get an answer which is close to the actual answer but is not exactly the same. We 
		  did not find it a good idea to spend much time on it as the main priority was 
		  parallel implementation.

How to compile
==============
	- parallel
		- cd parallel
		- chmod 755 genExpMat.sh
		- cd jnomics-code
		- ant jar
		- this will create jnomics-tools.jar

How to execute
==============
	- make sure you have latest version of R, BWA, SAMTools and bcftools installed

	- first of all, unzip following file in a folder named "test":
		- http://schatzlab.cshl.edu/data/challenges/challenge2.tgz
		- mv challenge2.tgz test.tgz

	- copy the following binaries into "test" folder:
		- cp `which bwa` test
		- cp `which samtools` test
		- cp `which bcftools` test

	- from "test" directory, fire following command:
		- start hadoop
		- rm -f nohup.out; ../parallel/genExpMat.sh ecoli.fa refgenes.ptt . 10 ../parallel/jnomics-code/jnomics-tools.jar bwa bcftools samtools expM

	- this will create an o/p file "expM" in "test" directory

	- now run R by typing "R" on command line and then do following:
		- A <- matrix(scan("expM", n = 100 * 10), 100, 10, byrow = TRUE)
			- 100 is the number of genes in test/refGenes.ptt file
			- 10 is the number of experiements test/t1.1.fq ... test/t10.1.fq
			- you can change these values as per the data set

		- heatmap(A): plots the heatmap (pops up a new window)
			- you can verify it with the output/heatmap.png

		- plot(ts(A, 1, 100, 1)): plots the time series (pops up a new window)
			- you can verify it with the output/timeseries.png

		- parcoord(A): plots the parallel coordinates (pops up a new window)
			- you can verify it with the output/parcoord.png
